**`print_hex_dump_bytes`: Quick Hex Dumping in Linux Kernel**

In the Linux kernel, `print_hex_dump_bytes` offers a streamlined version of the more detailed `print_hex_dump` function. Rather than requiring users to input all parameters, it assumes several defaults for quicker hex dumping. This function is especially helpful when you want a quick view of binary data without diving into the intricacies of formatting.

Let's break down its parameters:

- **prefix_str**: A custom string that will appear at the start of each line in the hex dump. It aids in distinguishing logs.

- **prefix_type**: Specifies the kind of prefix for each line of the dump. Options include showing byte offsets (`DUMP_PREFIX_OFFSET`), actual memory addresses (`DUMP_PREFIX_ADDRESS`), or no prefix (`DUMP_PREFIX_NONE`).

- **buf**: This is where you provide the pointer to the binary data you wish to print.

- **len**: Specifies the number of bytes from the buffer you intend to display.

Given its default settings, the function outputs at a `KERN_DEBUG` log level, has a rowsize of 16 bytes, groupsize of 1 byte, and includes ASCII representation at the end.

**2. Technical Interview Questions about this topic (and answers) ü§î**

*Q: How does `print_hex_dump_bytes` differ from the `print_hex_dump` function?*

*A: `print_hex_dump_bytes` is a shorthand version of `print_hex_dump`. While `print_hex_dump` requires explicit settings for log level, rowsize, groupsize, and ASCII inclusion, `print_hex_dump_bytes` assumes default values for these settings.*

*Q: What are the default settings when using `print_hex_dump_bytes` for log level and rowsize?*

*A: The default log level is `KERN_DEBUG`, and the default rowsize is 16 bytes.*

**3. Simple Explanation for Easy Recall üåº**

Imagine you're baking a cake. üç∞ `print_hex_dump` is like the full recipe, asking you to specify every ingredient's exact quantity. On the other hand, `print_hex_dump_bytes` is like a quick-mix version - just add water! You don't need to set everything; it already comes with predefined amounts (default values) for a faster and simpler baking experience. It's handy when you're in a rush and just want a glimpse of your sweet binary data without the full customization. üßÅ‚ú®
