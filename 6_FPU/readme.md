**1. Explain the technical concept ðŸ“˜**

**Avoiding Floating Point Usage in the Kernel**

The Linux kernel avoids using floating-point operations for a combination of performance, compatibility, and simplicity reasons:

1. **Performance**: Transitioning between integer and floating-point modes is costly.
- Context-switching involves saving and restoring several registers, and using floating-point operations would mean additional state information has to be saved and restored. This would slow down the process of switching between tasks.
 
2. **Simplicity**: By not utilizing the Floating Point Unit (FPU) in the kernel, there's no need to manage its state within the kernel, simplifying the kernel code. 

3. **Compatibility**: Some architectures don't have an FPU, so to maintain maximum portability and compatibility across all architectures, the kernel avoids FPU ops.

**2. Technical Interview Questions about this topic (and answers) ðŸ¤”**

*Q: Why doesn't the Linux kernel use floating-point operations by default?*

*A: The kernel avoids using floating-point operations to speed up context switching (by not needing to save/restore FPU state), to keep kernel code simpler, and to ensure compatibility across architectures, including those without an FPU.*

*Q: If a user-space process uses an FPU operation and the FPU is turned off, what happens?*

*A: If the FPU is off and a user-space process attempts an FPU operation, the operation will trap into the kernel. The kernel will then turn on the FPU, restore any saved state, and return to re-execute the FPU operation.*

*Q: Why is it a concern to manage FPU state within the kernel?*

*A: Managing FPU state adds complexity to the kernel's operations. It would also add overhead to context-switching, making task switches slower.*

**3. Simple Explanation for Easy Recall ðŸŒ¼**

Imagine you have a special pen that writes in glittering ink. It's beautiful but takes time to clean and is not needed for most tasks. If you used it every time you wrote something, you'd spend a lot of time cleaning and refilling it. 
Similarly, the Linux kernel avoids the "glitter pen" (or the FPU) because it's not often needed and would slow things down. Instead, it sticks to regular pens (integer operations) that are faster and simpler to use. If a special occasion arises where the glitter pen is needed (a user-space process requiring FPU), the kernel will bring it out, use it, and then neatly put it away.

No Use of Floating Point in Kernel
===================================

%f not allowed in kernel space

When a user-space process uses floating-point instructions, the kernel manages the transition from integer to floating point mode.

Why is floating point mode off?

	many programs don't use floating point or don't use it on any given time slice; and

	saving the FPU registers and other FPU state takes time; therefore

an OS kernel may simply turn the FPU off. Presto, no state to save and restore, and therefore faster context-switching. 

If a program attempts an FPU op, 
	the program will trap into the kernel, 
	the kernel will turn the FPU on, 
	restore any saved state that may already exist, and 
	then return to re-execute the FPU op.

At context switch time, it knows to actually go through the state save logic. (And then it may turn the FPU off again.)

The reason that the kernel doesn't particularly need FPU ops and also needs to run on architectures without an FPU at all. 

 Therefore, it simply avoids the complexity and runtime required to manage its own FPU context by not doing ops for which there are always other software solutions.
