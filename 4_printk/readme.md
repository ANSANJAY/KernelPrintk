**Utility of `pr_*` Macros in Kernel Logging**

In Linux kernel development, logging is of paramount importance. `printk` is the standard function used for kernel logging, but it can become cumbersome to prepend log levels (like `KERN_EMERG`, `KERN_ALERT`, etc.) for every message.

To streamline this, the kernel provides a set of convenience macros, `pr_*`, to automatically include the log level without explicitly mentioning it in the `printk` call. 

These macros enhance code readability and maintainability. For example, if you want to log an emergency message, instead of writing `printk(KERN_EMERG "Emergency issue with device %d\n", device_id);`, you can simplify it with `pr_emerg("Emergency issue with device %d\n", device_id);`.

Each `pr_*` macro corresponds to a specific log level and uses the `printk` function internally, with the level already defined.

**2. Technical Interview Questions about this topic (and answers) ðŸ¤”**

*Q: Why might one prefer to use the `pr_*` macros over the traditional `printk` function in kernel code?*

*A: The `pr_*` macros enhance code readability by automatically prepending the respective log levels. This leads to shorter, more readable, and maintainable code. It also reduces the likelihood of mistakenly using the wrong log level.*

*Q: Which macro would you use if you want to log an informational message without explicitly mentioning the log level?*

*A: For informational messages, you can use the `pr_info` macro.*

*Q: Are the `pr_warning` and `pr_warn` macros functionally different?*

*A: No, they are functionally identical. `pr_warn` is just an alias for `pr_warning`, providing developers with a shorter option.*

**3. Simple Explanation for Easy Recall ðŸŒ¼**

Think of the `pr_*` macros like shortcuts on your phone's keyboard. Imagine typing a message and wanting to express emotion. Instead of typing "I am happy", you could use the ðŸ˜€ emoji. Similarly, instead of using the longer `printk` with log levels, you can use the shorter and more descriptive `pr_*` macros to convey the same message in kernel code. 

For instance, if your code faces a critical issue, you don't need to type out the whole phrase with `printk`; you can just use `pr_crit` to quickly express the urgency!

There are other functions that we can use in place of printk() in order to have more efficient messages and compact and readable code:

#define pr_emerg(fmt, ...) \
        printk(KERN_EMERG pr_fmt(fmt), ##__VA_ARGS__)
#define pr_alert(fmt, ...) \
        printk(KERN_ALERT pr_fmt(fmt), ##__VA_ARGS__)
#define pr_crit(fmt, ...) \
        printk(KERN_CRIT pr_fmt(fmt), ##__VA_ARGS__)
#define pr_err(fmt, ...) \
        printk(KERN_ERR pr_fmt(fmt), ##__VA_ARGS__)
#define pr_warning(fmt, ...) \
        printk(KERN_WARNING pr_fmt(fmt), ##__VA_ARGS__)
#define pr_warn pr_warning
#define pr_notice(fmt, ...) \
        printk(KERN_NOTICE pr_fmt(fmt), ##__VA_ARGS__)
#define pr_info(fmt, ...) \
        printk(KERN_INFO pr_fmt(fmt), ##__VA_ARGS__)
