**`print_hex_dump`: Displaying Raw Data in the Linux Kernel**

Sometimes, while debugging or analyzing data in the kernel, developers need to examine raw binary data. Reading binary directly is challenging, so the kernel provides the `print_hex_dump` function, which turns that binary data into a readable hex dump, often paired with ASCII representations.

Here's a breakdown of the function's parameters:

- **level**: The urgency or severity of the message, determining where it will land in the kernel logs. Examples include `KERN_DEBUG` or `KERN_ERR`.
  
- **prefix_str**: A custom string that'll be prefixed to each line of the hex dump, making logs more identifiable.
  
- **prefix_type**: Defines the kind of prefix you want. It can be an offset (how many bytes into the buffer this line starts), the actual memory address of the line's first byte, or no prefix at all.
  
- **rowsize**: Defines how many bytes of data each line of the output will show. It's typically 16 or 32 bytes.
  
- **groupsize**: This clusters bytes together. For example, with a groupsize of 4, you'll see four bytes together, then a space, then the next four bytes, and so on.
  
- **buf**: This is the pointer to the actual data you want to print.
  
- **len**: Specifies how many bytes from the buffer you wish to print.
  
- **ascii**: If set to true, after the hex representation, an ASCII representation of the data will also be shown. Non-printable characters are typically shown as `.`.

**2. Technical Interview Questions about this topic (and answers) ü§î**

*Q: What is the primary purpose of the `print_hex_dump` function in the Linux kernel?*

*A: The `print_hex_dump` function is used to display raw binary data as a readable hex dump, often alongside an ASCII representation, making it easier to examine and debug data.*

*Q: How would you use `print_hex_dump` to display a buffer without any prefix and with ASCII representation at the end?*

*A: You would set the `prefix_type` parameter to `DUMP_PREFIX_NONE` and the `ascii` parameter to `true`. Other parameters would be set based on the specific data and display preferences.*

**3. Simple Explanation for Easy Recall üåº**

Imagine you found an old treasure map, but instead of symbols and X-marks, it's filled with weird 0s and 1s. üòµ‚Äçüí´ Deciphering it would be a nightmare! `print_hex_dump` is like a magical translator. You feed it the confusing map (binary data), and it turns it into a neat, readable format with organized rows and columns of hex numbers. Plus, if you ask nicely (set the `ascii` parameter), it'll even try to translate some of it into words or symbols you recognize. It's like getting a cheat sheet for your mysterious map! üó∫Ô∏è‚ú®üîç

void print_hex_dump(const char *level, const char *prefix_str, int prefix_type, int rowsize, int groupsize, const void *buf, size_t len, bool ascii);

Given a buffer print_hex_dump prints a hex + ASCII dump to the kernel log at the specified kernel log level, with an optional leading prefix.

level:
        kernel log level (e.g. KERN_DEBUG)

prefix_str:
        string to prefix each line with;

prefix_type:
        controls whether prefix of an offset, address, or none
        is printed (%DUMP_PREFIX_OFFSET, \ ``DUMP_PREFIX_ADDRESS``\ , \ ``DUMP_PREFIX_NONE``\ )

rowsize:
        number of bytes to print per line; must be 16 or 32

groupsize:
        number of bytes to print at a time (1, 2, 4, 8; default = 1)

buf:
        data blob to dump

len:
        number of bytes in buf

ascii:
        include ASCII after the hex output
